###GStreamer Environment
This is a simple implementation of a multimedia environment using the [GStreamer](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/)
framework. This environment uses the [libmicromb] (https://github.com/rodrimc/libmicromb)
(a higher level API built on top of GStreamer).

The samples (folder 'samples') have hardcoded file paths. The files used in the
samples are available [here] (http://club.ncl.org.br/node/48) (in the
'media' folder).
